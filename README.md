server-usage-demo
=================

Demo server usage app to experiment with websockets, react, and flux.

I started with the example TodoMVC app from https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/examples/todomvc-flux
From that base I created a simple page to view server load information (hard coded).  I had it retrieve this information
over a websocket to make it more interesting.

Running
=======
npm install

npm start
